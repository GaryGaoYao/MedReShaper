MedReShaper: An AI-Driven System for 3D Anatomy-Aware Shape Reasoning with Clinical Validation in Orbital Reconstruction Surgery

MedReShaper is an AI-based system for automatic 3D anatomic shape completion in clinical settings. It introduces a novel fishbone-structured network architecture, ASR-Net, capable of reconstructing anatomically plausible shapes from defective or incomplete medical mesh data. The system is validated on clinical and multi-center datasets, demonstrating sub-millimeter accuracy and strong generalizability.
