MedReShaper: An AI-Driven System for 3D Anatomy Shape Reasoning with Clinical Validations in Orbital Reconstruction Surgery

MedReShaper is an AI-based system for automatically completing 3D anatomic shapes in clinical settings. It introduces a novel fishbone-structured network architecture, ASM-Net, capable of reconstructing anatomically plausible shapes from defective or incomplete medical shapes. The system is validated on clinical and multi-center datasets, demonstrating sub-millimeter accuracy and strong generalizability.

Key Features:

🧩 End-to-end pipeline from PCA-based perception to mesh reconstruction

🧠 ASM-Net architecture with attention-based latent reasoning

📦 Input & Output: 3D meshes or point clouds

🔬 Clinically validated on orbital reconstruction cases

🌍 Multi-ethnic, multi-source datasets supported
