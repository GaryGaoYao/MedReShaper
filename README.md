# MedReShaper [to be published]
MedReShaper: MedReShaper: An AI-driven Workflow for 3D Anatomical Shape Modeling with Multi-Ethnic Clinical Validations in Orbital Surgery

MedReShaper is an AI-based system for automatically completing 3D anatomic shapes in clinical settings. It introduces a novel fishbone-structured network architecture, ASM-Net, capable of reconstructing anatomically plausible shapes from defective or incomplete medical shapes. The system is validated on clinical and multi-center datasets, demonstrating sub-millimeter accuracy and strong generalizability.
